# HeyAmp

This is the website of my personal business. I'm an electronics engineer and musician. I've been repairing effects pedals, pedalboards and amplifiers for my bandmates and friends for a very long time. One day my soulmate told me it was over and pushed me to begin repairing professionally in my shed. Since 2014 I've been running my one-person business on my own and I've had the opportunity to meet amazing and lovely people of all kinds, mainly musicians. This also got me the chance to play with people otherwise I'll never had an opportunity even to meet. So, this is the one thing in my life i'll never regret. Thank you.
